This program contains some os the most common sort algorithms to present a simple way to switch between then and compare its performance in same vector.

It also allow you to configure your vector changing vector size, and generating it randomly, ascendent or descendent. You can see this screen in the printscreens down below.

## Compiling and running

You can build this system in any linux-based system using gcc in root folder, as follow:
```
$ gcc main.c -o SortProgram
```

This will create a new executable in the project root path named SortProgram (or SortProgram.exe on windows). Now you only need to run it:

For Linux/MAC users:

```
./SortProgram
```

For Windows users, just double click on executable program.
